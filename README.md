# Learn SQL Alchemy

SQL Alchemy is a Python library for interacting with databases using Python Classes and Objetcs.
It uses a programming technique called ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

By using it we can interact with databases using pure Python without any SQL queries 

## This library has tow primitives:
